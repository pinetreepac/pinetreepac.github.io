Identify new liberty candidates and help protect existing liberty candidates. We helped 16 liberty candidates that were elected or reelected in 2022. We helped 12 candidates that had elections with the results so close, they went to a recount. A candidate we helped ended up winning by 8 votes, another candidate we helped only won by 10 votes, and another candidate we helped won by 15 votes. We even particiated in the recount process for these 3 candidates to help ensure their victories. The results were so close for these candidates that we very likely made the difference, putting these candidates over the top. That was critical because if these three liberty candidates wouldn't have won, the socialists and progressives would have won control over the New Hampshire House of Representatives. That's correct, the efforts of the Pine Tree PAC were critical in keeping a libertarian as the Majority Leader of the New Hampshire House.
