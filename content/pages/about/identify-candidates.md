In 2022, we helped 16 liberty candidates that were elected or reelected. We helped 12 candidates that had elections with the results so close, they went to a recount. The results were so close for 3 candidates we helped, that we very likely made the final difference, putting these candidates over the top. That was critical, because if these 3 liberty candidates wouldn't have won, the socialists and progressives would have won control over the New Hampshire House of Representatives. That's correct, the efforts of the Pine Tree PAC were vital in keeping a libertarian as the Majority Leader of the New Hampshire House.
